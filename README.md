# Macros for Foundry VTT

A collection of macros for the excellent [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/article/macros/).

## Award XP
Select one or more characters. If no characters are selected, the macro will use all PCs.

The dialog permits you to enter total xp or individual xps and vary the weights. On confirmation, the macro applies the xp to each character and outputs a summary to a chat message.

## Calculate Encounter XP

Basic XP calculator. Select one or more creatures. Adds up the XP; allows you to de-select or add additional xp for each creature. Ignores PCs.

## Greyhawk Initiative

Polls the list of combatants in the combat tracker. If you own more than one combatant, a dialog will ask you to select one or more. (All entities selected will use the same actions but not necessarily the same rolls.) 

Then a dialog asks for a set of actions based on [Unearthed Arcana Greyhawk Initiative rules](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dnd/downloads/UAGreyhawkInitiative.pdf) and rolls initiative accordingly. Assumes you installed a [module to reverse initiative](https://github.com/wakeand/fvtt-module-reverseinitiativeorder).
